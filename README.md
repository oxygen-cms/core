# Oxygen Core Framework

This repository contains the core framework for Oxygen.

Oxygen is a framework for building modern web applications.
At it's core, its just a small addon to the excellent (Laravel Framework)[http://laravel.com/],
however with the addition of many extensions, Oxygen becomes a full-featured CMS.
The modular nature of Oxygen means that you can pick and choose exactly how much you want, and make the framework into your own magnificent creation.

## Key Features

- **Modular**: you pick how much you need
- **Extensible**: everything about Oxygen, from it's clean UI to its core data structures, can be extended
- **Open**: Oxygen makes use of hundreds of awesome PHP packages, installed through (Composer)[https://getcomposer.org/]
- **Ready for Tomorrow**: Oxygen makes use of some of the latest technologies, such as PHP 5.4 and above, SCSS, CoffeeScript and Gulp.

## Development

Oxygen is currently under heavy-development, and an alpha release should be coming soon.
