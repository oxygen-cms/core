# Oxygen Core Framework

This repository contains the core framework for Oxygen.

Oxygen is a framework for building modern web applications.
At it's core, its just a small addon to the excellent [Laravel Framework](http://laravel.com/),
however with the addition of many extensions, Oxygen becomes a full-featured CMS.
The modular nature of Oxygen means that you can pick and choose exactly how much you want, and make the framework into your own magnificent creation.

## Key Features

- **Modular**: you pick how much you need
- **Extensible**: everything about Oxygen, from it's clean UI to its core data structures, can be extended
- **Open**: Oxygen makes use of hundreds of awesome PHP packages, installed through [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
- **Ready for Tomorrow**: Oxygen makes use of some of the latest technologies, such as PHP 5.4 and above, SCSS, CoffeeScript and Gulp.

## The Stack

Oxygen uses the Laravel PHP framework, which in turn is based off [Symfony](http://symfony.com/).
As well as Laravel, Oxygen uses countless other packages from Composer, however they are still in fluctuaction so they won't be listed here.

For the front-end, Oxygen's UI component uses [SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/) and [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) as preprocessors for CSS and JavaScript, and also uses [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) to manage build tasks.

## Development

Oxygen is currently under heavy-development, and an alpha release should be coming soon.
